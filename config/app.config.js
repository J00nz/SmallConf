 * this is the general configuration object that is given

 *
 * If you are conding at home you may want to run your app 
 * on your custom FireBase or you may want to apply configs
 * that are not meant to be pushed to the main repo.
 *
 * You should then create "app.config.local.js" which will
 * replace this file and it is already ignored by Git.
