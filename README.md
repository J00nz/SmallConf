`SmallConf` is a _single page application_ which provides an organization and social tool for meet up groups.

It is based on `ReactJS` and stores data in `FireSlide`. There is no "server side" in this app, everything is just frontend technology.

Enjoy it!

## Work on it!

### Requirements

1. We code on a Mac, you?
2. NodeJS 0.12.7

### Setup your Firebase

### Development

	# development session
	npm start
	
This script runs the transpiler in _watch_ mode, a development server that uses port `8080` and a `LiveReload` service on it's standard port.

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to run the app on your local machine!

### Release

	# test a release locally
	npm run release-server
